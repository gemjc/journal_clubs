Results of 2022 gender equality survey in Bordeaux Neurocampus.
From April to June 2022, a questionnaire was submitted to the Bordeaux Neurocampus community. The survey questionnaire is an adaptation of a questionnaire developed by the RESET 5 consortium.

**December 13**: Radhia Kacher, ICM, Paris
Presented paper: [Sexism in academia is bad for science and a waste of public funding (Boivin, N., Täuber, S., Beisiegel, U. et al. Nat Rev Mater (2023), DOI: 10.1038/s41578-023-00624-3
](https://www.ufz.de/export/data/2/282257_Boivin%20et%20al_Sexism%20in%20Academia.pdf). Higher education and research institutions are critical to the well-being and success of societies, meaning their financial support is strongly in the public interest. At the same time, value-for-money principles demand that such an investment delivers. Unfortunately, these principles are currently violated by one of the biggest sources of public funding inefficiency: sexism.

**November 15**: Violetta Zujovic, ICM, Paris
Presented paper: [Gender and retention patterns among U.S. faculty (Science Advances – Vol. 9, #42, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi2205)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adi2205)
